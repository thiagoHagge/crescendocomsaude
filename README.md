This was my first real PHP project.
So I was able to learn a lot about how to develop with this language and especially how to develop dynamic pages (to show the result of the quiz) and how to store information in databases (so that medical students can make analyzes from this information).


I also used a little bit of Bootstrap when it was the easiest method for design or utilities like modal, but I did most of the CSS on my own and was able to improve a lot regarding the properties of display, position and float.
